# A quick jQuery hack to circumvent Squarespace’s lack of support for internationalization

Since Squarespace doesn't provide internationalization support at all; only $ and everything in English. So I decided to do a simple jQuery hack. This is a simple tutorial of what I did.

## How to use this

1. Clone the repo
2. Check out the code
3. PROFIT!

## Warning

This is by no means a super “kosher” way to fix this problem; if someone doesn’t have Javascript, they will still see the original values in English.

However, since the HTML5 features give me the exact dates and times, even in those cases, the content is still accessible, and english is not an obscure language, so I believe this is acceptable as a temporary solution.

I’m not a developer, so if you think there’s a better way to do this, feel free to contribute! :)
